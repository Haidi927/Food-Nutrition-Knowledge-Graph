# Knowledge-Graph-Construction-for-Food-Nutrition

In this study, Food Nutrition, China Food Composition List, and Baidu Encyclopedia were used as data sources to design a framework for constructing food nutrition knowledge graph by constructing 7 types of node labels and 15 types of relationships.
Its pattern layer is as follows:

Due to the unpublished paper and the confidentiality of the project, we have only published a part of the data as a formal presentation. We have not yet published complete data in the dataset. The complete dataset and the construction method will be fully disclosed after the publication of the paper.
