# SpERT: Span-based Entity and Relation Transformer
PyTorch code for SpERT: "Span-based Entity and Relation Transformer". For a description of the model and experiments, see our paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07755 (published at ECAI 2020).

## Setup
### Requirements
- Required
  - Python 3.5+
  - PyTorch (tested with version 1.4.0)
  - transformers (+sentencepiece, e.g. with 'pip install transformers[sentencepiece]', tested with version 4.1.1)
  - scikit-learn (tested with version 0.24.0)
  - tqdm (tested with version 4.55.1)
  - numpy (tested with version 1.17.4)
- Optional
  - jinja2 (tested with version 2.10.3) - if installed, used to export relation extraction examples
  - tensorboardX (tested with version 1.6) - if installed, used to save training process to tensorboard
  - spacy (tested with version 3.0.1) - if installed, used to tokenize sentences for prediction

### Fetch data
Fetch converted (to specific JSON format) CoNLL04 \[1\] (we use the same split as \[4\]), SciERC \[2\] and ADE \[3\] datasets (see referenced papers for the original datasets):
```
bash ./scripts/fetch_datasets.sh
```

Fetch model checkpoints (best out of 5 runs for each dataset):
```
bash ./scripts/fetch_models.sh
```
The attached ADE model was trained on split "1" ("ade_split_1_train.json" / "ade_split_1_test.json") under "data/datasets/ade".

## Examples
(1) Train CoNLL04 on train dataset, evaluate on dev dataset:
```
python ./spert.py train --config configs/example_train.conf
```

(2) Evaluate the CoNLL04 model on test dataset:
```
python ./spert.py eval --config configs/example_eval.conf
```

(3) Use the CoNLL04 model for prediction. See the file 'data/datasets/conll04/conll04_prediction_example.json' for supported data formats. You have three options to specify the input sentences, choose the one that suits your needs. If the dataset contains raw sentences, 'spacy' must be installed for tokenization. Download a spacy model via 'python -m spacy download model_label' and set it as spacy_model in the configuration file (see 'configs/example_predict.conf'). 
```
python ./spert.py predict --config configs/example_predict.conf
```
## Reproduction of Experimental Results
- The final models were trained on the combined train+dev datasets (e.g. 'conll04_train_dev.json').
- Reproduction of SciERC results: To add a feature, the sampling of negative symmetric relations needed to be changed in commit [7b27b7d](https://github.com/lavis-nlp/spert/commit/7b27b7d258d0b4bb44103b9d0f9e19f2ce08611f). This lead to a slight improvement of experimental results for SciERC. Please use commit [3f4ab22](https://github.com/lavis-nlp/spert/commit/3f4ab22857f9ca0d96b582084a2a0ceb3e9826f9) if you want an exact reproduction of the ECAI 2020 paper results.


## Additional Notes
- To train SpERT with SciBERT \[5\] download SciBERT from https://github.com/allenai/scibert (under "PyTorch HuggingFace Models") and set "model_path" and "tokenizer_path" in the config file to point to the SciBERT directory.
- If the model predicts many false positive entity mentions, try to increase the number of negative entity samples ('neg_entity_count' in config file).
- You can call "python ./spert.py train --help" / "python ./spert.py eval --help" "python ./spert.py predict --help" for a description of training/evaluation/prediction arguments.
